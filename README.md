## üèÅ Final Steps

1. **Monitor Node Status**:
   - After the script completes, visit the Drosera dashboard at [https://app.drosera.io/](https://app.drosera.io/) to check for green blocks indicating node liveness.
   - You can also view Docker logs to monitor the nodes:

     ```bash
     cd ~/Drosera-Network
     docker logs drosera-node1
     ```
or

   ```bash
     cd ~/Drosera-Network
     docker logs drosera-node2
   ```

   - Check That you Have Green Block Log on your Dashboard ( Wait For At Least 1 Hour To Check )

     cd ~
     cd my-drosera-trap
     source /root/.bashrc

     cd Drosera-Network
     docker compose up -d
